# Numeral Systems
A generalization of roman numerals. These allow any symbols and values associated
with those symbols. For example a system with the following symbols, `I, V, X, W`
corresponding to the values `1, 5, 10, 16`, can create the value `36` with the
numeral`WWIV`. It is mostly a novelty nonetheless may be useful if you are interested 
in using roman numerals or a specialty system. Roman Numerals can be accessed through
the `ROMAN_NUMERAL_SYSTEM` constant of the module.
